Hello.

Since so many of you wonderful people came along to the summer bash at Expedia in August, I thought it would be lovely to hang out again to discuss diversity, share our experiences and have a few festive drinks and nibbles.

It will also be a chance for me to (briefly) introduce my startup Jeneo, which aims to boost diversity in the tech sector. Apart from that, all you'll need to do is come along, hang out with some of the best people in tech in the UK and have fun!

If you didn't come to the last party, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/paul_clarke/sets/72157685895792604">here are a few snaps</a> to give you a flavour of what it will be like.

Thanks,

Charlotte
