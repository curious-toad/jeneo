I"Ü<p>Hello.</p>

<p>Since so many of you wonderful people came along to the summer bash at Expedia in August, I thought it would be lovely to hang out again to discuss diversity, share our experiences and have a few festive drinks and nibbles.</p>

<p>It will also be a chance for me to (briefly) introduce my startup Jeneo, which aims to boost diversity in the tech sector. Apart from that, all youâ€™ll need to do is come along, hang out with some of the best people in tech in the UK and have fun!</p>

<p>If you didnâ€™t come to the last party, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/paul_clarke/sets/72157685895792604">here are a few snaps</a> to give you a flavour of what it will be like.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Charlotte</p>
